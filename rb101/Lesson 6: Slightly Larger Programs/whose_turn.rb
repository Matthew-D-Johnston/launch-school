# Can you change the game so that the computer moves first? Can you make this a
# setting at the top (i.e. a constant), so that you could play the game with
# either player or computer going first? Can you make it so that if the
# constant is set to "choose", then your game will prompt the user to determine
# who goes first? Valid options for the constant can be "player", "computer",
# or "choose".
