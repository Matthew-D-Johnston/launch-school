Introduction to PEDAC
=====================
A problem-solving approach to coding:  

P - [Understand the] **P**roblem
E - **E**xamples / Test cases
D - **D**ata Structure
A - **A**lgorithm
C - **C**ode

## P - [Understand the] **P**roblem

Understanding the problem has three steps:  

1. Read the problem description;
2. Check the test cases, if any;
3. If any part of the problem is unclear, ask the interviewer or problem requester to clarify the matter.  

To conclude this part of the PEDAC process, you need to write down what the inputs and outputs for the problem are. You should also describe the rules that you must follow. The rules should encapsulate all the explicit and implicit requirements in the problem. So, you should identify what the explicit requirements are, write them down, and then repeat the process for the implicit requirements.

## E - **E**xamples / Test cases

Think of potential examples and test cases: think of the potential input and what should be expected as an output.

## D - **D**ata Structure

Should one use an array or a hash?

Start writing your pseudo-code.

Example of pseudo-code for Data Structure:
```
input: string, array, hash, etc.
ouput: string, array, hash, etc.
rules: explain the rules that must be followed, both explicit and implicit.
```

## A - **A**lgorithm

Use pseudo-code: outline the logic of the code with possible variable names. Break up the code into separate logical pieces; perhaps, the separate pieces can be written as individual methods.

## C - **C**ode

Write the code.
