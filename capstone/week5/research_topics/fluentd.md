## Fluentd

#### What is Fluentd?

Fluentd calls itself an open source data collector for unified logging layer. It allows you to unify data collection and consumption for a better use and understanding of data (https://www.fluentd.org/).

Fluentd is a data collection tool.

Fluentd deals with core concerns and leaves specific use cases up to plugins.

##### Unified Logging with JSON

Fluentd tries to structure data as JSON as much as possible: this allows Fluentd to **unify** all facets of processing log data: collecting, filtering, buffering, and outputting logs across **multiple sources and destinations** ([Unified Logging Layer](http://www.fluentd.org/blog/unified-logging-layer)). The downstream data processing is much easier with JSON, since it has enough structure to be accessible while retaining flexible schemas (https://www.fluentd.org/architecture).

##### Pluggable Architecture

Fluentd has a flexible plugin system that allows the community to extend its functionality. Our 500+ community-contributed plugins connect dozens of [data sources](https://www.fluentd.org/datasources) and [data outputs](https://www.fluentd.org/dataoutputs). By leveraging the plugins, you can start making better use of your logs right away (https://www.fluentd.org/architecture).

#### Why Use Fluentd?

##### Unified Logging Layer

Fluentd decouples data sources from backend systems by providing a [unified logging layer](https://www.fluentd.org/blog/unified-logging-layer) in between.

This layer allows developers and data analysts to utilize many types of logs as they are generated. Just as importantly, it mitigates the risk of "bad data" slowing down and misinforming your organization.

A unified logging layer lets you and your organization make better use of data and iterate more quickly on your software (https://www.fluentd.org/why).

#### Why We Need Log Data?

Log data may be needed for the following reasons:

* compliance
* security
* debugging

#### How Applications Log Data?

* write to files
* log directly into a database

Logs are written in different formats and come from a variety of sources, including third parties. This creates challenges for being able to read and analyze the data from the logs.

#### How Does Fluentd Work?

Fluentd is deployed into the cluster and starts collecting logs from all the applications, such as self-owned and third-party applications. 

All of these log data will be in different formats (e.g. JSON format, Nginx format, custom format, etc.). Fluentd will process and format the log data into a uniform format.  

Fluentd is also able to enrich the data with additional information for each log entry.  

Fluentd can then send the processed data to any destination (e.g. elastic search, mongoDB, Kafka, etc.). Fluentd is not tied to any particular backend.

#### Summary

Fluentd is an open-source data collection tool and a log shipper. It is used to collect and ship logs and other event data from various sources to multiple destinations. Fluentd is designed to be highly scalable and flexible, and it provides a plugin architecture that allows it to be extended to support a wide variety of data sources and outputs. Some of the key features of Fluentd include:

- Log and event collection: Fluentd can collect logs and events from various sources, including system logs, application logs, and other event data.
- Data routing: Fluentd can route data to different destinations based on rules defined in its configuration file.
- Data transformation: Fluentd provides a powerful data transformation mechanism that allows you to modify and manipulate data as it is being processed.
- Data buffering: Fluentd provides a flexible buffer management system that allows you to handle data in real-time, even if the destination is temporarily unavailable.
- High availability: Fluentd can be deployed in a highly available configuration, ensuring that data collection and shipping continues even if one of the instances fails.

Overall, Fluentd is a popular tool used for log management and data collection in large-scale systems, especially in cloud environments and microservice-based architectures (https://chat.openai.com/chat: what is fluentd?).
