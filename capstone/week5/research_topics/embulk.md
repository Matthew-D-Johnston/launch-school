## Embulk

#### What is Embulk?

Embulk is a bulk data loader. It helps data transfer between types of databases, storages, file formats, cloud services, and else (https://www.embulk.org/).

#### What is Bulk Loading?

Very much like it sounds, bulk loading is a process whereby one can load large amounts of data into a database in a relatively short period of time (https://www.idera.com/glossary/bulk-loading/).

Database indexes are typically optimized for inserting rows one at a time. However, when you need to load a lot of data all at once, inserting rows of data one at a time is often very slow and inefficient (https://www.idera.com/glossary/bulk-loading/).

Bulk loading is used when you need to import or export large amounts of data relatively quickly. With bulk loading operations, you donâ€™t just insert data one row at a time; data is instead inserted through a variety of more efficient methods based on the structure of the specific database (https://www.idera.com/glossary/bulk-loading/).

Bulk loading operations are typically not logged and transactional integrity can therefore be an issue. Bulk operations also frequently bypass triggers and integrity checks such as constraints. Bypassing these slow processes can significantly improve data loading performance, resulting in the operation taking much less time than loading data by rows (https://www.idera.com/glossary/bulk-loading/).

#### Embulk Plugins

Embulk supports plugins to add functions (https://github.com/embulk/embulk). Embulk offers different types of plugins, including input type and output type:

* Input plugins enable Embulk to read data from input data sources.
* Output plugins enable Embulk to send data to output data destination.

(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oKpvgstKlgmgUUja8hYqTqWxtwsgIbONoUaEj8lO0FE/edit).

Embulk supports the ability to create new plugins or extend the functionality of existing ones (https://angelosalexopoulos.medium.com/embulk-multiple-filtering-9cc0f3081b35).

#### Summary

Embulk is an open source data transfer tool and bulk data loader that helps to load large amounts of data from various sources into data stores such as databases and cloud storage. It is written in the Java programming language and provides a high-performance, flexible, and scalable solution for data migration and integration tasks.

With Embulk, you can configure and run data transfer tasks using YAML configuration files, making it easy to automate and repeat data transfer processes. It supports a variety of input and output plugins for different data sources and stores, including file formats such as CSV, JSON, and Avro, as well as databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Amazon Redshift.

Embulk is designed to handle large-scale data processing efficiently, with features such as parallel processing, resumable and restartable execution, and automatic retrying of failed transactions. It is commonly used in big data, data warehousing, and data integration projects, and is well suited for use cases where you need to move large amounts of data quickly and accurately (https://chat.openai.com/chat/12b822fe-7ae3-4c1e-a44f-04cefb7d64f2: what is embulk?).
