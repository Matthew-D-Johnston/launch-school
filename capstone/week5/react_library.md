## Article: "Is React a Library or a Framework? Here's Why it Matters"

#### React is a library, not a framework

* Frameworks, such as Angular, include lots of built-in tools for building large-scale applications.
* Everything that you need to make a complete application is included in your Angular project when it's generated, which is not the case with React.

#### React is "unopinionated"

* The React and React DOM libraries provide the means to build a user interface with the JSX syntax, as well as powerful state management tools via hooks, among other things.
* However, React itself does not include many of the React-specific libraries needed for most projects.

#### Since React is a library, you must choose the tools on your own

* In order to build complete React applications, you will need to choose these packages and tools on your own.

#### The tools you choose depend on your app and knowledge of them

* What tools to use depnds on the demand of your app and your preferences as a developer.
* React doesn't lock you into one choice or hold you to any specific libraries other than React itself.
* This gives you more flexibility as a developer.

#### You need to keep up with emerging libraries

* Because React is a library and not a framework, one must keep up with a large shifting network of libraries. Some of these libraries may fall out of favour and be replaced or may become deprecated.
* One must pay closer attention to what is going on around React, which wouldn't be the case so much if React were a framework.

#### There are many React frameworks

* These React frameworks provide developers with a more powerful set of built in tools.
* Examples include Next.js, Gatsby, and Redwood.js.
* Frameworks mean less choices throughout the development process.
