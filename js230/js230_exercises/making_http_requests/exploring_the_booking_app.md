## Exploring the Booking App

#### Exercise

You'll be using a booking app throughout the exercise group, "Making HTTP Requests." To help you explore the documentation, try answering the following questions by running the server, opening your browser, visiting `/doc`, and carefully reading the documentation available for each route in the app. The app has seed data, so you can freely test out the different routes. You should only need to visit one route to determine the answer; if you'll need to visit more than one route, then the answer is *"There is no route that will provide this information."*
