## Exotic Animals

Create a page that displays a grid of animal images and shows a tooltip for each animal that contains more information about the animal.

#### Requirements

- Choose any animals that you want.
- Create markup that includes an image and caption for each animal.
- Hide the captions initially.
- Display the caption as a tooltip when the user hovers the mouse cursor over the image for more than two seconds. Close the tooltip when the user moves the mouse off the image.
- Don't display the caption tooltip when the user moves the cursor off the image before the two second time delay elapses.  

See the [demo app](https://dbdwvr6p7sskw.cloudfront.net/js-exercises/mini_projects/misc_gui_projects/01_exotic_animals_tooltip/index.html) for an example application.

###### CSS

```css
@import url("whitespace-reset.css");

body {
  background: #335;
}

h1 {
  margin-top: 20px;
  margin-bottom: 30px;
  text-align: center;
  color: #fff;
  font-size: 28px;
}

figure {
  width: 22%;
  margin-left: 2%;
  display: inline-block;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
  vertical-align: top;
  padding: 10px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  background: #fff;
  border-radius: 3px;
  position: relative;
}

figcaption {
  display: none;
  width: 300px;
  padding: 10px;
  height: 150px;
  border-radius: 4px;
  background: rgba(0, 0, 20, 0.7);
  color: #fff;
  z-index: 5;
}

figcaption.show {
  display: inline-block;
  position: absolute;
  margin-left: -90%;
  margin-top: 10%;
}

img {
  width: 100%;
}
```

#### My Solution

###### JavaScript

```javascript
"use strict";

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  let images = document.querySelectorAll('img');

  for (let index = 0; index < images.length; index += 1) {
    images[index].addEventListener('mouseenter', event => {
      let figcaption = event.target.nextElementSibling;

      let mouseLeft = false;

      images[index].addEventListener('mouseleave', event => {
        mouseLeft = true;
      });

      setTimeout(() => {
        if (!mouseLeft) {
          figcaption.classList.add('show');
          images[index].addEventListener('mouseleave', event => {
            figcaption.classList.remove('show');
          });
        }
      }, 2000);
    });
  }
});
```

#### LS Solution

Tooltips are a useful and unobtrusive way to show additional information to the user. The information stays out of the way when not needed and shows up when the user wants it. This exercise provides us with an opportunity to use some browser events, DOM manipulation, and to practice implementing this useful UI element.
